===========
Quick start
===========

To use the recipe, add in your buildout configuration file
a section like this::

    [buildout]
    parts =
        ...
        sphinxbuilder
        ...
    
    [sphinxbuilder]
    recipe = collective.recipe.sphinxbuilder:write


That's it ! Run your buildout and you will get:

- a new script in the `bin` folder, called  `sphinxbuilder`
- a `parts/sphinxbuilder` directory containing your documentation.

To build your documentation, just run the sphinx script::

    $ bin/sphinxbuilder

You will get a shiny Sphinx documenation in `docs/html`.
To write your documentation, go in `docs/source`, if there is none create it.
Everytime source is modified, run the buildout and script again.

A good starting point to write your documentation is: 
http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html.
